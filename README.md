# PersonalEngine
This project has been developed since mid 2016 at first for my games design and development module. Since then I have been been actively
contributing to my engine in the hopes of being able to finish it and produce games on the side of my career.

It is written in C# and uses the monogame framework for things such as Update looping and Render drawing. 

Includes Entity Lifecycle system
Entity Management
MVC
Design Patterns
Pathfinding
Physics
Collisions (Basic SAT & AABB)
Steering Behaviours (AI)
Events
State Machines

Future goals for the engine include

Quad trees for spatial partitioning

Better use of HLSL shaders

Rework of SAT Collision implementation

Rework of Steering Behaviours, wired up to the FSM machine
